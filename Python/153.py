# 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

# Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

# (i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

# Find the minimum element.

# You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

# Example 1:

# Input: [3,4,5,1,2]
# Output: 1
# Example 2:

# Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
# Output: 0
